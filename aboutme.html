            Having started wanting to make my own games, I was browsing YouTube and saw people were releasing their own custom
            mods of older games: some basic, some expansive. The ability to make my own spin on a game was intriguing, so as I
            was Googling around and came across a dedicated fansite for one of my favourite games on one of my favourite
            consoles, Sonic Retro. It was here that I discovered my first tool, and while it was completely limited in what it
            could actually do, my life wouldn't be the same again.

            Somewhat frustrated due to the limited scope and the options that could do some serious work crashed the
            program, I decided I wanted to do more. At the time, I had seen programming and assembly just from offhand
            accounts as some absolutely daunting task and any guides on it ended up confusing me more, until I found a wonderful
            video series by one of the admins on SSRG that was a step-by-step guide on how to port the spindash into Sonic 1.
            All of a sudden, the entire landscape had changed.

            Since that day, I have been teaching myself new languages until I came across CodeNation. Let's see how it goes!
