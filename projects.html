        <p class="boldheading">Game Genie Address Decoder</p>
        <p class="whitetext">This was the first homebrew program that I had written from scratch, and its purpose was to decode the
            Game Genie format into an address:patch format, as the Game Genie format is convoluted and involves many bit shifts
            across several byte boundaries. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/r6tux07hmrnx2c5/GGATT.rar?dl=0">LINK</a>

        <p class="boldheading">ISO9660 SCD</p>
        <p class="whitetext">This is a program which generates a readable disk image to the ISO 9660 standards, created to allow for
            more flexibility with input data, designed for Sega CD games to follow the format listed in the technical specifications
            that the other ISO file system programs seem to struggle with. [LINK MISSING, MAY BE LOST :()]

        <p class="boldheading">Mega Drive Input Test</p>
        <p class="whitetext">This was a controller diagnostic ROM I had created for the Mega Drive designed to test controller
            inputs over a 2 second window. Since these consoles are getting older and the internals are wearing down, it's tailor
            made to test actual hardware with a flashcart. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5l4zzhp59my53w3/ROM.bin?dl=0">LINK</a>

        <p class="boldheading">Sega Master System Checksum Fixer:</p>
        <p class="whitetext">This was a project I had created to fix the checksum that the Master System would check to allow
            homebrew games to run, as the bootstrap ROM's code wouldn't allow the game to run if the checksum was incorrect.
            I later found out that flashcarts wouldn't check the checksum somehow, however I still feel that it was a good
            exercise in translating Z80 code to C, especially for the checksum calculation which uses an 'add with carry'
            instruction which takes advantage of the Z80 processor's internal carry flag. <a href="https://github.com/Dandaman955/MSChecksumFixer">LINK</a>

        <p class="boldheading">Mega Drive RPG Game:</p>
        <p class="whitetext">This is the first major project I had taken on, I wanted to create my own custom RPG on the Sega Mega
            Drive, while I managed to get a prototype battle system, sprite system and overworld programmed in, the project has been
            stuck in a pre-alpha state since 2019. [LINK MISSING, MAY BE LOST :()]
