            Hi! My name is Daniel Hall and welcome to my archival website for all of my projects. This is a list of all of the
            work I have created over the past 13 years, all collated into one single website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, there have been instances where I have gone on to make a project that hasn't survived to the current day,
            for a multitude of reasons. Reasons such as poor archival practices, file hosting websites being taken down
            without any surviving copies (for instance Megaupload), files with documentation lost over IRC and projects I'd
            simply forgotten about. This website aims to give a surviving copy of whatever projects I have that are still known
            to exist, along with a description of its functionality.
        </p>
